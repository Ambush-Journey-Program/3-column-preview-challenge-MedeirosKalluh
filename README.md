## The Challenge

### Briefing

- Your challenge is to build out this 3-column preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

- [Frontend Mentor Base](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/3column-preview-card-component-pH92eAR2-)

- While you’re doing that we’ll create new `branches` for each new piece of your website, then send it to GitHub when the code is done, and open **Code Review.** The goal is to get used to the development cycle.

- **Your users should be able to:**
  - View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
  - See hover states for interactive elements

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- [ ] See hover states for interactive elements

### Tips

- Apply BEM CSS name convention.
- Use flexbox and media queries to make the page responsive.
- Use CSS relative units instead of absolute units (use `rem` instead of `px`).
- **BONUS**: use CSS variables for the colors to reuse the values and make the code more readable.
